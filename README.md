## Design Choices

I approached this project by deeply understanding what Chai Culture represents - **heritage, royalty, and the warmth of tradition**. Here's how I translated that into design:

### Color Philosophy
The color palette mirrors the chai experience itself:
- **Deep Brown (#1e120b)** - The rich color of perfectly brewed chai
- **Royal Gold (#C6A45E)** - Representing luxury and premium quality
- **Warm Cream (#F6F1EA)** - The comforting color of milk meeting chai

### Typography
- **Playfair Display** for headlines - A serif font that conveys tradition and sophistication
- **Inter** for body text - Clean and modern, ensuring readability

### Animation Approach
Subtle, purposeful animations create a premium feel:
- Scroll-triggered reveals that tell a story as users explore
- Character-by-character tagline reveal for dramatic impact
- Floating elements with golden glow that feel alive without distraction
- Smooth scrolling throughout for a luxurious browsing experience

### Heritage Elements
I incorporated traditional Indian design motifs:
- Subtle paisley patterns nodding to traditional textile art
- Corner ornaments inspired by royal Indian architecture
- Golden accents throughout, reflecting the regal nature of the brand
